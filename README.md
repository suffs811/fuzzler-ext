# Fuzzler Limited - Web Extension
--------------
Fuzzler Limited is a Chrome extension for pentesting that creates tailored password lists by crawling a webpage and fuzzing each word according to specific rules (append/prepend digits 0-99, all uppercase, all lowercase, reversed, and translated to 1337 speak).

*For example, Fuzzler Limited found 9,442 words on this webpage and then generated 537,338 words after using AI/NLP and fuzzing.*

> The full Fuzzler CLI tool can be found [here](https://github.com/suffs811/fuzzler)
